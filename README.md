🖐️🎙️ Voice Control Using Hand Recognition
A project that integrates OpenCV and machine learning to enable voice command control through hand gesture recognition. This system identifies specific hand gestures via a webcam and triggers corresponding voice commands for seamless interaction.

🚀 Features
🤖 Hand Gesture Detection: Recognizes predefined hand gestures using OpenCV.
🗣️ Voice Command Mapping: Maps gestures to specific voice commands (e.g., play, pause, volume control).
🎥 Real-time Processing: Detects and processes gestures in real time.
💡 Customizable: Easy to train with new gestures and commands.
🛠️ Tech Stack
Frameworks and Libraries
Python (Programming language)
OpenCV (Computer vision for gesture recognition)
Scikit-learn (Machine learning for gesture classification)

🔧 How It Works
Hand Detection:

OpenCV detects the hand in the webcam feed using contour detection or a pre-trained model (e.g., MediaPipe Hands).
Gesture Classification:

Extract features like hand landmarks, and classify gestures using a trained ML model (e.g., SVM or Decision Trees).
