🛠️ Tech Stack
Python (Programming language)
Tkinter (UI framework for creating the graphical interface)
SQLite / MySQL (SQL database for data storage)


🧑‍🏫 How It Works
UI Development:

Tkinter is used to build a windowed application with buttons, entry fields, and tables for displaying student data.
The UI allows users to add, update, delete, and search for students.
Database Integration:

The application uses SQLite or MySQL to store student records.
Data is managed using SQL queries, and the Tkinter interface interacts with these queries to fetch and display records.
SQL Operations:

Add Student: Insert new student records into the database.
Update Student: Modify details of an existing student.
Delete Student: Remove a student record from the database.
Search Student: Find students by name or ID.
